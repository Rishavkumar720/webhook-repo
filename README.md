# ðŸš€ Webhook Listener with Flask, MongoDB, and Dashboard

This repository (`webhook-repo`) contains the code for a **GitHub Webhook Listener** built using **Flask** and **MongoDB Atlas**. It captures events like `push` and `pull_request` from another GitHub repository (`action-repo`) and stores them in MongoDB. It also includes a simple **dashboard** to display the stored events.
